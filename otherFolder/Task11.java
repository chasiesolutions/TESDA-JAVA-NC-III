/*
Task: Create a Java class to represent a Book and implement a constructor to initialize its attributes.
Instructions
Create a new Java class called Book with the following attributes:
- String title 
- String author 
- int yearPublished 
- double price 
Implement a constructor in the Book class that takes four parameters corresponding to 
the attributes and initialize them.
Create a main method in a separate class to test the constructor:
- Instantiate three Book objects with different values using the constructor. 
- Print out the details of each book (title, author, yearPublished, and price) using toString(). 
Example Output
Book 1:
Title: "Java Programming"
Author: "John Smith"
Year Published: 2021
Price: $39.99

Book 2:
Title: "Python Basics"
Author: "Jane Doe"
Year Published: 2020
Price: $29.99

Book 3:
Title: "C++ Essentials"
Author: "Michael Johnson"
Year Published: 2019
Price: $49.99
